				L-Tron delivers a tightly packaged box of wrangled insanity tied together with disarming potency and four-on-the-floor beats. This is more than dance music, this is don't think about how you dance music. In motion it's equal parts beauty to blister. Opening the blinds, L-tron gives you a glimpse of the demons at his doorstep and the sword he uses to slay them. In this four track EP, dance music structure is melted down and recast, leaving your ears to search for a sound that isn't. Even if your feet haven't moved by the end of it all, you will have gone somewhere.

				It's been a few years since Kris Keyser's last EP, and the incubation period seems to have done him well - this eponymous EP sounds like equal parts fire and water, danger and safety. At times it's dark, though still hopeful. It's loud, but nuanced. This is the sound of one LSDJ cart stretched to its limits, yet it finds balance in the midst of the storm.

Sound Blaster 16 sound cards, Radlib keeps the party moving and
creates electro-house free-for-alls via FM synthesis. Long live OPL3.

				"This is a pretty serious release," said Jellica in the email that accompanied my copy of Safafa. Like all great British eccentrics, Jellica is very serious about everything he does, whether he's giving his tracks utterly unpronounceable titles, penning musical homages to cats or indulging in some of the most expressive free-dance you're ever likely to see on stage at a chip gig. With Safafa, he's set his sights even higher: nothing less than an epic counter-factual voyage to the stars, wherein space was conquered in the 80s by an Amiga-fixated generation of British kids. The tempos are slower on Safafa but Jellica's LSDJ magic is as intricate and textured as ever, reflecting the contradictions of a journey where the enormous speeds achieved are dwarfed by the vast distances yet to be covered. All in a day's work for Jellica - a serious man, but all the more fun for it.– Matt Nida

				In his sophomore 8bitpeoples release, IAYD (I Am Your Destruction) returns from the depths of the cosmos, armed with an arsenal of arresting arias. Burning white hot and furious, his concussive calls-to-arms serve as much to inspire as to enrage. Composed of three parts bête noire, two parts rancor, Like A Phoenix destroys and disrupts. Prepare yourself for the impact of this anthemic anthology, spanning the years 2008-2010.– Chris Foxmastering by Chris Burke, artwork by iLKke

After landing his ship on the small island known as Earth, he shows the people the things he has discovered and peace is restored again.  Even if only for a brief time, our hero is happy to take a well needed rest from defending the galaxy.  In his third album, Sievert gets back to his punk-ska roots to celebrate all of the things he loves: good times, good friends, beer, dogs, cartoons, pizza, chips, dips, and face-rips.

				I'll start by mentioning that you can count the number of Chinese electro artist worth knowing about on one hand, and with A.M.U, it's definitely your right thumb you should be raising. The album name Diamond fits without a doubt, as this truly is a rare gem. A.M.U has shown surprising maturity for a Chinese kid, so far away from all the western hype, and he is already leading the 8-bit music craze in the Middle Kingdom. Heavy beats, insane melodies, smart programming and unusual bleeps ... A.M.U's ability to provide strong dance floor tracks straight out his Gameboy comes from his experience touring and smashing Beijing and Shanghai's clubs with his unexpected DJ sets. Do not miss the chance to listen to Diamond - this jewel of an EP will surely end as your favourite new 8-carat ear piece!– TNEMartwork by iLKke

				It's surprising to me as someone who generally isn't that big on chip music that I'm on my third straight play through minusbaby's new album, Derecha. And even though I admittedly get fidgety and impatient on hearing more than one song at any given time in any given genre (chronic musical ADD), here I am humming along like an asshole, more forcefully with each repeated listen, ad-libbing riffs here and there while I finger-drum beats on my desktop like a white Candido, and quickly approaching my fourth return listen. As an album, it's a mature progression from his previous EP, Left. And it's damn good. And I want to tell people about it, but what do I even say?  It's chip music, but it doesn't sound like something from any video game I played when I was a kid. It's new music made with old-school mentality using a combination of sounds that could either be from 1985 or 2085. It's funky, it's danceable, it's composed, it's cerebral, it's performing a complicated samba throughout the Southern Hemisphere at times. It's all of these and yet it's none of these. In a word, it's minusbaby. Dylan Garret, DJ • New York, NY • July 2010

Coova’s artillery of choice is the Nintendo Game Boy with the Nanoloop 1.5 ammo cartridge whilst little-scale’s war science research department has developed a weaponised strain of the SEGA Nomad. The result is an armed force to be reckoned with, ready to do battle on any audio playback system at high volumes.

The original crew have been dead for decades and their descendants are forced to scavenge in the huge craft's shadowy maze of decaying rooms and corridors. Kept alive by the ship's few remaining atmosphere systems, this is the soundtrack to the remaining survivors lonely voyage through the cosmos. Written using a Game Boy and some junkshop FM and GM keyboards, Desmos is a journey that invokes as much of the spirit of Oldfield as Jellica can possibly bring himself to summon and attempts to show off the DMG-01's synthesis capabilities to their fullest using a long squiggly line of wobbly electro.

Linde's 8bitpeoples debut showcases his more ambient and floaty musical strata using simple FM synthesis and a couple of slow-working years of on and off tinkering with the songs. The resulting track list is a chronological journey of trance inducing loops, mellow pads, buzzing leads and bubbling sound effects all put together during unhealthily late nights, forming an unmistakably digital, yet organic, science fiction soundtrack. Listen and enjoy.

Underwater, biology and technology morph into each other while the open air grows stale.

				Roland had studied the data on the first four cartridges for a very long time, when he realized that the lamprey was hiding a fifth inside it's mouth. Discovered, the lamprey wheezed and sputtered, blowing air through the cartridge in an attempt to make it sound out a tune. Confused and frustrated, it spat the item out into the sand and disappeared into the vast, toxic lake. Roland dried it off, inserted it into the DMG, pressed start and heard the growling waveforms emerge. This sound brought to him the realization that a year had passed in this wasteland and there was now much work to be done.

				The first time I listened to "Left" I was 6,000 feet above sea level being driven in a car navigating the winding roads of the Himalayas. The last time I listened to "Left" was a few minutes ago while watching some writers at the 5Pointz graffiti spot in Queens. Both times I was mentally transported to a place between those two extremes – the majestic and the everyday. Can something be both timeless and fresh? It can when the bass is the base and each snare truly ensnares.

Once again, minusbaby has shown us the proto-urban; an audio space where an imaginary city is built in the mind's eye from the rawest materials and yet still seems to be polished and eternal. Please, enjoy, as I do, the reductive/constructive paradox which is minusbaby's perpetual rhythm machine and sip and nibble from one of the most inconspicuously nuanced suppers ever to disguise itself as a snack. Simplicity was never so deceptive.

In their 8bitpeoples debut EP, "Future, and It Doesn't Work", Starscream tell a tale of victory, science, and potentially catastrophic foreign policy.

Embark on a journey through the cosmos with six, powerful masterworks crafted from the dregs of shattered asteroids and the rusted husks of space vessels. Pushing forward and brimming with profound sonic vivacity, "Supergalactic" leaves you with a greater understanding of the Universe.

Jazz, deep funk, disco, R&B, and full-on techno inflections collide and merge into an astonishing stylistic cocktail, all topped off with a shimmering pro-grade production sensibility. Dazzling artwork by Ui completes the package, sealing the deal on a certain future classic.

The lamprey was willing, for the moment, to help him search the debris for the small cartridges that fit into the DMG, each one supplying a new, crucial piece of information. The hidden truth would be thus revealed to him slowly, in sequence.

				This release is testament to the positive social effects of alcohol ... On the one hand Nullsleep plied gwEm with drink to encourage him to agree to
do an 8bp release, on the other hand gwEm spiked Nullsleep's drink so that
he'd agree to make it a live album.  When it came to finding someone
to record the show gwEm and Random ended up plying each other with drink
until they realized the logical course of action. Sadly, gwEm's long time
creative partners MC Counter Reset and Colin needed no such alcoholic
encouragement. Shows in Hell are easy to get, but hard to come back from. The next best thing we could find was the Bethnal Green Workingman's Club in London's east end. This is the pure sounddesk recording of a very special gig. The only instruments you hear are one Atari STe, a drum kit, and a Flying V through a seriously cranked Marshall.

Ecstatic bursts of cascading waveforms race toward uncertainty. A feeling of ever increasing separation develops. Unattainable distances are approached and sheets of white noise issue forth from the fissures of an obsessively restructured reality. The sound surrenders in memory of another time and place, to which we can never return.

Since 2004, he has mashed up  the sounds of a Game Boy, a Nintendo Entertainment System, a Commodore 64 and an Atari 7800 to create intelligent dance-pop with beautifully honed lyrics and vocals laced with vicious lashings of the guitar. Critically acclaimed as an unstoppable live act, Firebrand Boy is currently turning heads on the Scottish gig circuit, and is determined to take his brand of fired-up electronica-with-a-heat across the UK and beyond. Firebrand Boy gets the shakes if he does not eat enough, and his girlfriend thinks he is pretty high up on the autism spectrum. Somehow he's survived long enough for 8bitpeoples to release his long overdue Songs for Cake. Hopefully you'll survive listening to its silly pop charm.

				What you think is a Game Boy is quite possibly a guitar. In Open Air, Joey Mariano aka Animal Style meshes his jazz guitar playing proficiency with Game Boy programming skills and compositional command.  The concept for this release was to create a more organic sound while retaining most of the classic textures that chip music connoisseurs enjoy.  Masking his guitar with the 8bit fuzz pedal, Mariano secretly adds a human touch to the robot-compliant world of chip music.  Bring in some splashes of PCM flavor, some raw zaps, a few introspective breakdowns, a couple improvised guitar solos, a pulsing beat and you get the picture: The horizon of chip music is open -- and full of possibilities.

				Gijs Gieskes is an industrial designer from the Netherlands who is probably best known for the fascinating mechanical devices he constructs for musical and visual expression. However, with 'Molen' his debut release on 8bitpeoples, he puts aside physical implements and we find him operating solely within the digital realm. Despite the change in approach his songs retain a clockwork feeling, sometimes breaking down in surprisingly charming ways. As they whir, stutter and plod along delightfully toward some unseen destination one can't help but imagine their creator standing by, watching and smiling.

Xinon provides five weapons-grade anthems, the bittersweet melodic prowess of 'Attitude' setting up the bomb perfectly for the hard hitting 'Vanishing Point', providing a critical blow to the enemy! Jetting hyperspeed into his adversary , Sabrepulse unloads a salvo of differing styles, with  the ultrasweet pop dance party of 'Hey Kate' at variance with the bass-laden sting of 'Venom'. This collection will open your ears to the realization that international chiptune relations are stronger than ever.

So its with great pleasure that we present Multi-Boxer, their debut 	8bitpeoples release and a truly brilliant one at that.  Enjoy the didgeridoo and famicom too.

A little muse the	shape of an onion swamp, memories formed in an 8-bit sound chip and a folk guitar. These are some songs Mark DeNardo wrote for you. Thanks	to Jeremiah, Miles, and David.

From quirky playful beats to refined vocal performances, Psilodump hits hard in this most sonically lush of 8bitpeoples releases. With a diverse mixture of thick textures and lo-fi samples, 'Mutiny of the Robots' is a diversion from naked chip music, but if it doesn't make you want to get naked anyway, you're probably a robot yourself.

These boys from Argentina combine catchy and danceable lo-fi synths with robotic voices and sing about the things that matter most in cyberspace. Their minimalist synthpop stylings are uniquely personal and hypnotizing. This is one confession that everyone should be happy to hear.

				Vim AKA Keith Baylis has been writing some of the most uniquely imaginative chiptunes since 1991. Now, 15 years later we present you with his debut 8bp release, Extended Loo Break — seven Game Boy tracks written by Vim during a stint at an utterly boring job during 2002 and 2003. With little to do during the workday, tunes were written while hanging out around reception, at the bus stop, or (as the title suggests) while in the toilets. The result is an all-out lo-fi assault that flies in the face of workplace boredom — and scores a stunning victory.

Blending vgm with indie rock and many other influences, Handheld uses Game Boys to create what VORC calls a "sweet but broken unexpectable sound" — and somehow that just seems to describe it perfectly.

Viva La Revolution is a killer chiptune odyssey from start to finish, full of unexpected twists and turns, and finishing in some parallel universe where Mozart kicked off the chiptune revolution. The very same revolution that Dorothy's Magic Bag is keeping alive today.

If his guerilla actions with the mobile street techno art unit 'Tsuji Techno' have not already convinced you of USK's passion for the form, this hard hitting collection of tunes will.

In his debut 8bitpeoples release he has crafted a true land of fake believe in the form of a soundtrack to a videogame which never existed. Blast is filled with urgent melodies and driving, busy rhythms in the tradition of early 16-bit game soundtracks. The release is reinforced by outtakes of young Alex's earliest conceptions of what he envisioned the game to be, under the supervision of his father — the result is a distinctly unique release 15 years in the making.

Spanning his early Logic Bomb 180bpm chip and bass onslaughts, his more recent crossover material, and everything in between, it is a testament to his journey through the world of Game Boy infused chipmusic. And it might just cement Mr. Sugar as the first underground popstar of the 21st century.

Knocking the NES out, shoving it in his trunk and driving to a remote location for undisturbed access to all it's registers.

				The debut release from Amor Antiquita offers up six exquisite experiments in melody and harmony. Making use of both SID and NES soundsets within its framework, the album contains a wealth of both flagellant and comforting sounds. Each track has been carefully crafted for optimum listening pleasure, and may cause involuntary tapping of the foot, bouncing of the knee, and in extreme cases possible loss of bladder control.

				Mesu is back and you're probably wondering what manner of chip-twisting electro weirdness he's bringing this time. Belle Isle Raceway is an homage to the now defunct Detroit Island, known for the oldest aquarium in the US and home to social gatherings of all types for many many generations. Italodisco fused with lo-fi funk bounces you along through most of the tracks, with Mesu's signature sounds of arpeggiated resonance there to guide you as always of course. In Belle Isle's future you might imagine a race of sorts ... blistering through the wasteland and shredding through the stratos. That just might be what it will look like, and this just might be what it will sound like.

Random is surely one of the brightest young rising stars of the Game Boy scene. Chip dance boost! The path may be full of struggles, but in the end it's all very simple ... it's going to be a happy ending after all.

				These modules are a complete defragmentation of my system.From the second I became self-aware my sensory units were bombarded with stimuli. To categorize and label these I devised a temporary subprogram to aid me in this process.I called it Shawl. The stream of input caused Shawl to expand continously. Eventually she grew beyond her preset parameters and bad blocks started appearing. I had to address this. Defrag is a year of processing human culture and emotions.To create my own expression.

				The debut release from Trash80 is a chip-wave dance thriller filled with party-rocking beats and gameboy bleeps. Featuring vocal mayhem by Jemgirl, these tunes will have you jumping up and down, pumping your fist and wishing for the future to get here quicker ... or is it, for the past to come back forever? You know this feeling, its the feeling you got when you looked at those chips and bits when you were just a kid and thought you were living in the future. Well this is what yesterdays future sounds like.

				My earliest memory of a monkey is the scene in "Kingukongu tai Gojira" where King Kong opens a giant snake's mouth so far beyond it's natural extention point that it eventually looks like a mushroom with a long, wiggly, scaled stem. Sure, King Kong is an ape but to a 4 year old, it was a very big monkey with an attitude problem. It was also pretty bad-ass. So, in return for playfully horrific imagery, I managed to write an album dedicated to all things apish and monkeyed. Don't accept any imitations, this album is more real than Diddy Kong's learned vocabulary.

A departure from his earlier work, this cd packs a punch of flamboyant catchy synths, heavy electro bass lines and slamming drums. If you want to dance or maybe throw yourself around singing like you're Steve Perry this CD is for you.

This follow-up to his party-rocking debut remains true to the style he set there, only this time treating us to completely original material.  Mesu synthesizes powerups from pure waveforms before sending them flying on vectors straight into your ears like blazing starfighters from the 8bitpeoples galactic empire.

Some of the best electro remixes of classic 80s pop songs on the planet, this album is sure to amaze you ... whether you are amazed at the fresh stylings Mesu Kasumai gives these old tunes or the fact that someone could still be so obsessed with a decade that brought us such wonders as the Rubik's Cube and Max Headroom is another question. So get ready to be blown away by nonstop megahits from the likes of Michael Jackson, Gary Numan, Cyndi Lauper, Billy Idol rewritten in what one could argue must be some bizarre alternate universe. This is one rocking release you will not soon forget ... for better or worse!

				This was made over Christmas break 2000. I was at my parents house on vacation and stayed up late making the tracks with Buzz Tracker, which I had just downloaded. I used the same samples and effects for all of them. The EP is full of crunchy beats and melodic sustained synth sounds. Everything is a bit peaked out. As for the concept, each song represents a color on Simon. The color, hopefully, corresponds to the sound in some way.

While it may be impossible to predict what will happen at each performance, one constant can be expected: a forceful equatorial beat. Each familiar song is given new variation while the center holds it down with a bassy bottom end to make anything bump and bounce that hasn't been tied down, exploding the very meaning of 8-bit orchestration.

Since 1999, he has come to prominence in the chip music scene, with a foundation in New York City and the 8bitpeoples. He has performed extensively, having been featured in London's DMZ Media Arts Festival, the International Chiptune Resistance, Blip Festival 2007 and 2008, multiple Pulsewave nights, headlining the premiere of The Tank's "Less Than Three" and Philadelphia's only monthly chip music event, 8static.

Recently, he completed a seven show, month-long European tour playing Bleep London and Chipfest IV in England, Blip Festival Europe in Denmark, Bang! in Portugal, two sets at Era New Horizons in Poland and Budapest Micro 2 in Hungary.

In addition to music, he is a prolific pixel artist who, since 2001, has been largely responsible for defining the unique aesthetics of the modern 8-bit creative movement. Spearheading the visual identities of 8bitpeoples, Pulsewave and the Blip Festival has contributed to making minusbaby's work ubiquitous to the public's perception of chip music and art.

His work, which he has referred to as, "a practice in primitivism, but mostly a stab at trying to continue several traditions at once," is often guided by a central idea meant to be interpreted by the individual. Combined with his love for patterns, type and limited color palettes, minusbaby has developed his own unique visual language. Rather than easing into the more common pixel trends, he utilizes multiple sources outside of video game culture to broaden both his and the movement's repertoire so as to expand the canon and avoid Super Mario cannons.
