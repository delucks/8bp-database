Each familiar song is given new variation while the center holds it down with a bassy bottom end to make anything bump and bounce that hasnt been tied down, exploding the very meaning of 8-bit orchestration.Since 1999, he has come to prominence in the chip music scene, with a foundation in New York City and the 8bitpeoples. He has performed extensively, having been featured in Londons DMZ Media Arts Festival, the International Chiptune Resistance, Blip Festival 2007 and 2008, multiple Pulsewave nights, headlining the premiere of The Tanks "Less Than Three" and Philadelphias only monthly chip music event, 8static.Recently, he completed a seven show, month-long European tour playing Bleep London and Chipfest IV in England, Blip Festival Europe in Denmark, Bang! in Portugal, two sets at Era New Horizons in Poland and Budapest Micro 2 in Hungary.In addition to music, he is a prolific pixel artist who, since 2001, has been largely responsible for defining the unique aesthetics of the modern 8-bit creative movement. Spearheading the visual identities of 8bitpeoples, Pulsewave and the Blip Festival has contributed to making minusbabys work ubiquitous to the publics perception of chip music and art.His work, which he has referred to as, "a practice in primitivism, but mostly a stab at trying to continue several traditions at once," is often guided by a central idea meant to be interpreted by the individual. Combined with his love for patterns, type and limited color palettes, minusbaby has developed his own unique visual language. Rather than easing into the more common pixel trends, he utilizes multiple sources outside of video game culture to broaden both his and the movements repertoire so as to expand the canon and avoid Super Mario cannons.','/images/portraits/minusbaby.gif?1303684254');

And even though I admittedly get fidgety and impatient on hearing more than one song at any given time in any given genre (chronic musical ADD), here I am humming along like an asshole, more forcefully with each repeated listen, ad-libbing riffs here and there while I finger-drum beats on my desktop like a white Candido, and quickly approaching my fourth return listen. As an album, its a mature progression from his previous EP, Left. And its damn good. And I want to tell people about it, but what do I even say?  Its chip music, but it doesnt sound like something from any video game I played when I was a kid. Its new music made with old-school mentality using a combination of sounds that could either be from 1985 or 2085. Its funky, its danceable, its composed, its cerebral, its performing a complicated samba throughout the Southern Hemisphere at times. Its all of these and yet its none of these. In a word, its minusbaby. Dylan Garret, DJ • New York, NY • July 2010			','/images/albums/large/8BP110.gif?1303684284');

Both times I was mentally transported to a place between those two extremes – the majestic and the everyday. Can something be both timeless and fresh? It can when the bass is the base and each snare truly ensnares.Once again, minusbaby has shown us the proto-urban; an audio space where an imaginary city is built in the minds eye from the rawest materials and yet still seems to be polished and eternal.

Sure, King Kong is an ape but to a 4 year old, it was a very big monkey with an attitude problem. It was also pretty bad-ass. So, in return for playfully horrific imagery, I managed to write an album dedicated to all things apish and monkeyed. Dont accept any imitations, this album is more real than Diddy Kongs learned vocabulary.			','/images/albums/large/8BP036.gif?1303684271');
